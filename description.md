Understanding the transmission dynamics in different geographic scales could inform the public health response to ongoing epidemic diseases. In this study, we partnered with the Houston Health Department (HHD) to develop a statistical model and a computational pipeline to reconstruct the geographical distribution of SARS-CoV-2 using genomic data.

Texas has the most counties in the United States. Each of the 254 Texas counties is assigned to one of 11 public health regions. However, for administrative purposes, there are eight regional public health offices. Our dataset contains more than a thousand distinct zip code records (across 208 different counties). We convert zip code records into public health regions to simplify the statistical model and accelerate computational speed. Here, we assigned the public health region as the interest of trait, and we investigated the geographic diffusion pattern between different health regions in Texas during the Delta wave in mid-2021. The greater Houston area, which is our research focal, is in Region 6/5S.
